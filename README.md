# Bro2Bro

A web application for connecting with your peers by saying bro repeatedly.  Inspired by an app of the same name seen in [this clip](https://youtu.be/OVoFzu-vH4o) from the show Silicon Valley.

The website was visually styled with plain HTML/CSS, and the functionality was implemented with JavaScript, Node.js, and Socket.io.  The current build is only hosted on my laptop.

I plan on finishing this app in the next few weeks by adding a few more key features, including creating different rooms as users join.  I will also limit the number of messages that can be visible on the screen concurrently.  I then plan on hosting the server on either Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud, to make testing significantly easier.

I also plan on adding several hidden "bro"s that are slightly more difficult to access, and potentially even a text feature, which is why there are unused "message" variables in script.js.
